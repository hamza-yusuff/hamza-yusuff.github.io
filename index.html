                <h1>Hey, I am <span class='hey'>Hamza Yusuff</span></h1>
                <p>
                   I am a full-stack developer and an aspiring entepreneur studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I am mostly interested in backend development, algorithms, system design and machine learning, but I also love turning mundane algorithms into magnificient visuals with the tools of front-end technology.
                   On April, I successfully a founded a startup with two of my friends, and we are planning to launch the full version of our app by october, fingers crossed !!.  
                   <br>I have previously worked at the Radiotherapy Department of Chittagong Medical College Hospital as a backend developer, and at Chittagong Grammar School as full-stack developer. 
                   Alongside, I have individually worked on several web and cryptographic projects, and you can find all of them on my Github.
                   Currently, I am looking for fall 2021 internships.
